                    <p> Born and raised on the West Coast of California, Paulina's love for photography started when given a disposable camera at an early age. Photography was something that was
                        something used to record birthdays, holidays, trips, or lots of nature photos. Each to hold a memory or capture something on a still image.</p>

                    <p> Now after learning how to work a camera, it was time to capture their own memories of events that they find interesting. Nature photography is
                        the subject Paulina has decided to capture. Showcasing beautiful displays of nature; from the tiniest flower, to the birds, the land, anything
                        that can capture what is being shown. Showing nature from their views and finding ways to convey the message to others.
